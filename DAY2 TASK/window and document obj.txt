1. Write a blog on the difference between document & window objects

 window:

The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM)

document:

A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.


The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object. Properties related to window objects are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.

There was a document object too so what about it then?

So after the window gets loaded then thereâ€™s a document (HTML, PHP, or another document) loaded inside that window, and the properties related to that document is stored in the document object. Properties related to document objects are title, URL, cookie, etc.

Syntax:

window object:
window.propertyname;
document object:
document.propertyname
// OR
window.document.propertyname
